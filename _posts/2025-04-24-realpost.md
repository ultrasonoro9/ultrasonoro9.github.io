First off, welcome! I have wanted to have a place where others can come to learn a little more about the mind of Clifton Capes. This site is a start.

The posts and articles that I write or link to are of interest to me at the time and may be interesting to someone else. Most of these are things I want to learn more about myself, so I am learning by researching enough about the subject to write. Don't read too much into the subject matter, though, as you will see the topics are varied and frankly, pretty random.

There is no self-written description here where I awkwardly try to explain who I am. Even if I thought I could describe myself, how could you know that what I am saying is the truth? The tendency can be to project an image that is less a reflection of who a person is, but is instead who they feel they need to be to impress others. I'm not immune to that myself, so instead I will write about things I find interesting at the time, and you can draw your own conclusions.
